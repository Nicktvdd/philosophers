# Philosophers

In the realm of philosophy, a timeless ritual unfolds: Eat, Sleep, Spaghetti, Repeat. The "Philosophers" project invites you to explore the intricate world of multi-threading and precise timing, as we guide a group of philosophers to pick up forks and savor their spaghetti without succumbing to hunger.

## Introduction

This project originated as a collaborative endeavor, with contributions from the talented minds of [Teemu](https://github.com/Stte), [Jun](https://github.com/composerjunhee), and [Rasmus](https://github.com/RushMaverick) and me. We embarked on a collective journey to tackle the challenge at hand. At the finish, I refined the codebase and reshaped the functions to align with my coding style.

## Key Concepts

- **Multi-Threading Mastery:** Dive deep into the world of multi-threading and concurrency, mastering the art of parallelism to simulate the philosophical dining experience.

- **Precise Timing:** Explore the intricacies of timing and synchronization, ensuring that philosophers pick up their forks and dine without succumbing to the hunger pangs.

- **Collaborative Development:** Witness the evolution of a group project into a refined piece of work, where individual contributions blend seamlessly into a cohesive whole.
