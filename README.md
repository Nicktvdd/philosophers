# philosophers
Eat, Sleep, Spaghetti, repeat. This project is about learning how threads work by precisely timing a group of philosophers on when to pick up forks and eat spaghetti without dying from hunger.

We worked on it as a group project with @Stte, @Kimpozer and @RushMaverick for most of the time. I finished it by myself and rewrote the functions to fit my style.
